# StockGrid

A stock market portfolio manager for the ASX

A single-page web app for investors to monitor the performance of their stocks on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Users can create custom portfolios to organise their investments into meaningful groups. Provides graphs for historical and intraday data so performance can be assessed at a glance.

Technologies used:

- React with Hooks
- Google Firebase for authentication
- Google Cloud Firestore for database (NoSQL)
- Data visualisation using Plotly
- Netlify to host static content using CI/CD workflow with Github
- REST for third-party API data (www.worldtradingdata.com)

## WorldTradingData API no longer operating

The third-party API that this app used to source data from has since closed down so the app no longer works. However, the landing page and authentication is still live at: https://stockgrid.netlify.app/
